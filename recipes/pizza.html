        You can make this Garlicky Kale and Ricotta Pizza on any type of dough you 
        like. This time around, I needed something a bit softer so that I could chew it
         with my braces on, so I went with my classic Pizza Dough recipe. Another couple 
         of good options are my Thin and Crispy Pizza Crust, or my Honey Wheat Pizza Dough. 
         But you could certainly buy a store-bought pizza dough if you’re short on time. I 
         hear Trader Joe’s has an excellent ready-to-go pizza dough!

        <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400ºF</li>
        <li>Place the minced garlic and olive oil in a large pot and sauté over medium heat for about one minute, or just until the garlic is soft and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stretch your pizza dough (about 12-14") and place it on your pizza pan. </li>
        <li>Bake the pizza for 15-20 minutes, or until the crust has browned, the cheese is melted.</li>

    </ol>
