        I love it when a few simple ingredients can come together to create something truly delicious and I think rice krispie treats are one of those magical ingredient combinations. It’s literally four simple ingredients but together they become a new magical thing that is simultaneously melt-in-your-mouth, soft and chewy, and also light and crispy. They’re just *mwuah* perfection. I like to make mine a little extra soft so that sweet marshmallow melts away to the crispy rice cereal within. You won’t be cutting the roof of your mouth on these babies! Just soft, gooey, marshmallowy goodness!
